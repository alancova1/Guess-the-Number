# Guess-the-Number
Author: Alan Covarrubias.
Project Name: Guess the Number.
The goal of this project is to create a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or if it is correct. This project helps demonstrate basic programming concepts in C++ such as loops, and random number generation.
